# Harmonic Distortion and Spectral Purity Analysis using FieldFox N9917B

This project uses the Keysight FieldFox N9917B to analyze the harmonic distortion and spectral purity of its internal CW signal generator. By looping the RF output back to the input, we measure the power of the fundamental tone and its harmonics at frequencies like 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz using the built-in spectrum analyzer.

## Highlights
- No external components required â€” fully self-contained loopback test
- Quantifies Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)
- Demonstrates RF signal integrity analysis and test instrumentation skills
- Relevant to wireless hardware validation and compliance testing 

## Repo Structure
- `data/`: Exported spectrum data (.csv)
- `plots/`: Spectrum and THD visualizations
- `scripts/`: Python analysis code
- `hardware_setup/`: Loopback photos
- `report/`: Final write-up (PDF)
